git fetch
👉 Gets new data from the remote repository(updating remote-tracking branches(origin/main))
(no code comparison, no file changes)

git diff

👉 Shows differences between two states of code
(no downloading, no updating)
| `git fetch`                      | `git diff`             |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Downloads changes                | Shows differences      |
| Updates remote-tracking branches | No changes to repo     |
| Network operation                | Local operation        |
| Does not show code differences   | Shows code differences |

git remote prune origin
checks the remote origin
finds remote branches that were deleted
removes their remote-tracking branches locally


| Merge                    | Rebase                        |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Preserves history        | Rewrites history              |
| Creates merge commit     | No merge commit               |
| Safe for shared branches | Dangerous for shared branches |
| Non-linear history       | Linear history                |


SSH (Secure Shell)
SSH is a secure network protocol used to connect to remote computers securely and transfer data in encrypted form.
In Git, SSH is used to authenticate and communicate with remote repositories without entering a username and password every time.
You create an SSH key pair (public + private)

Public key is added to GitHub/GitLab

Private key stays on your computer

Git uses the key to authenticate securely

Reset(rewrites history)
-----
git reset moves the HEAD (and optionally branch pointer, staging area, and working directory) to a specified commit.
Git reset --hard  HEAD~1//

1️⃣ git reset --soft 🟢
git reset --soft HEAD~1
What it affects

✅ Moves HEAD

❌ Does NOT touch staging

❌ Does NOT touch working directory
Undo commit but keep changes staged

2️⃣ git reset --mixed 🟡 (DEFAULT)
git reset --mixed HEAD~1
What it affects

✅ Moves HEAD

✅ Resets staging area

❌ Does NOT touch working directory

3️⃣ git reset --hard 🔴 (DANGEROUS)

What it affects

✅ Moves HEAD

✅ Resets staging

✅ Resets working directory


Revert(preserves history)
------
git revert creates a new commit that undoes the changes of a specific commit without rewriting Git history.
Instead of removing a commit, it adds another commit that reverses it.

git revert <commit-hash>
git revert HEAD~3..HEAD

Reverting a merge commit 

git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>
-m 1 → parent branch to keep


Restore
--------
git restore is used to restore files in the working directory or staging area from a commit, index, or HEAD.
It undoes file changes

It does NOT touch commit history

✅ You messed up a file
✅ You want to unstage changes
✅ You want to discard local edits
❌ You want to undo a commit → use git revert

Undo changes not yet staged:git restore file.txt

git restore --staged file.txt
✔ Removes file from staging
✔ Keeps changes in working directory

Patch
-----
git diff > changes.patch (Differences between your working directory and the staging area (index)
git diff HEAD~1 HEAD > last_commit.patch
Or
git format-patch HEAD~1
git apply changes.patch



Branching
---------
Issue is called conflict.

Git branch name
Git switch -c name //create and switch
Git branch -d name

Be in main and use 	git merge branch name

Merging techniques:- fast forward merge, three way merge

Git stash
Git stash apply
Git stash clear


git pull        # = fetch + merge
# or
git rebase origin/main
