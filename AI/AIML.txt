Batch size = how many training examples the model processes before updating its weights.

Instead of learning from one example at a time, the model learns from a batch.





Supervised
----------
Supervised Learning is a type of Machine Learning where:

You train a model using labeled data

Each data point has:

Input (X) → features

Output (Y) → correct answer (label)


Classification
--------------
Logistic Regression

KNN

Naive Bayes

SVM

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Neural Networks

Regression
---------
Linear Regression

Polynomial Regression

Ridge / Lasso

| Problem               | Loss Function             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Regression            | MSE, MAE                  |
| Binary Classification | Binary Cross Entropy      |
| Multi-class           | Categorical Cross Entropy |

| Metric    | Meaning                       |
| --------- | ----------------------------- |
| Accuracy  | Overall correctness           |
| Precision | Correct positives             |
| Recall    | Found positives               |
| F1-score  | Balance of precision & recall |
| ROC-AUC   | Threshold independent         |



K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
------------------
KNN is a supervised, non-parametric, lazy learning algorithm used for classification and regression.
1️⃣Choose the number K
2️⃣ Calculate distance from new point to all training points
3️⃣ Select K nearest neighbors
4️⃣ Classification → majority vote
5️⃣ Regression → average of values

Recommendation Systems (Movies / Products)

Scenario:
You watch action & sci-fi movies.
How KNN works:
Find users with similar viewing history
Recommend what they liked
👉 “Users similar to you liked this.”

Naive Bayes
----------
Naive Bayes is a supervised, probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes’ Theorem, with the 
“naive” assumption that features are independent.
P(C∣X)=P(X∣C)P(C)/P(X)

Decision Tree
-------------
A Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm that makes decisions by asking a series of questions and 
splitting data like a tree structure.
Loan Approval System 💳

Questions (nodes):

Is income > 50,000?

Credit score > 700?

Existing loans?

Decision (leaf):

Approve / Reject loan

👉 Exactly how banks think.

Random Forest
------------
Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that builds multiple decision trees and combines their 
results to make a more accurate and stable prediction.
Instead of trusting one tree, it trusts the wisdom of many trees.

example:Stock Market Trend Prediction

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
----------------------------
SVM is a supervised learning algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane which separates 
data points of different classes with the maximum margin.
Face Recognition 👤

High-dimensional pixel data

SVM separates facial features effectively



Unsupervised
------------
Unsupervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on unlabeled data and tries to discover hidden patterns, structures, or 
relationships in the data without knowing the correct output in advance.

1. K-Means Clustering
---------------------
K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm that groups data into K clusters based on similarity.
1️⃣ Choose number of clusters K
2️⃣ Randomly initialize K centroids
3️⃣ Assign each data point to the nearest centroid
4️⃣ Recalculate centroids (mean of cluster points)
5️⃣ Repeat steps 3–4 until centroids stop changing

1️⃣ Customer Segmentation 🛒

Group customers by buying behavior

Used in marketing campaigns

2️⃣ Image Compression 🖼️

Group similar pixel colors

Reduce number of colors

3️⃣ Document Clustering 📄

Group similar news articles

Topic discovery


Hierarchical Clustering
-----------------------
Hierarchical Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that builds a hierarchy (tree) of 
clusters instead of forming a single flat partition.

Start with data points and keep merging or splitting clusters step by step, creating a hierarchy.


1️⃣ Start with N clusters (each point = one cluster)
2️⃣ Compute distance between all clusters
3️⃣ Merge the two closest clusters
4️⃣ Recalculate distances
5️⃣ Repeat until one cluster remains

1️⃣ Document Clustering 📄

Group research papers by topic

Subtopics naturally form

2️⃣ Biological Classification 🧬

Species → genus → family → kingdom

Natural hierarchy

3️⃣ Customer Segmentation 🛒

High-level groups → sub-groups

Useful for marketing strategies


Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
--------------------------------
PCA is an unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional 
data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving maximum variance.

1️⃣ Standardize the data
2️⃣ Compute covariance matrix
3️⃣ Calculate eigenvalues & eigenvectors
4️⃣ Choose top K eigenvectors
5️⃣ Project data onto new axes

1️⃣ Image Compression 🖼️

Reduce pixel dimensions

Keep important visual features

2️⃣ Face Recognition 👤

Reduce facial feature space

Faster matching

3️⃣ Data Visualization 📊

Convert high-dimensional data into 2D/3D plots
