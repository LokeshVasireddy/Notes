Why Asynchronous Programming?
JavaScript is single-threaded, which means only one task runs at a time.

So if you do something slow (like fetch data or wait for a file), JavaScript can’t stop and wait — otherwise your entire app would freeze.

✅ Solution:
Use asynchronous patterns like:

Callbacks

Promises

async/await

Event loop
