Idempotency means:

Performing the same operation multiple times produces the same result as performing it once.

| HTTP Method | Idempotent? | Reason                                     |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **GET**     | ✅ Yes       | Only fetches data                          |
| **PUT**     | ✅ Yes       | Replaces resource completely               |
| **DELETE**  | ✅ Yes       | Deleting again has no effect               |
| **POST**    | ❌ No        | Creates new resource each time             |
| **PATCH**   | ❌ Usually   | Partial update may change state repeatedly |

✅ What is an ETag?

ETag (Entity Tag) is a unique identifier provided by the server to represent the current version of a resource.

🟢 First Request

Client requests resource

GET /users/1


Server responds with data + ETag

200 OK
ETag: "v1a2b3"


Client:

Stores response

Stores ETag

🔁 Second Request (Conditional)

Client sends:

GET /users/1
If-None-Match: "v1a2b3"


Server checks:

If resource unchanged

➡️ Response:

304 Not Modified


(No body sent)

✅ Client uses cached data

| Status Code                 | Meaning                     |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **200 OK**                  | Resource changed            |
| **304 Not Modified**        | Resource unchanged          |
| **412 Precondition Failed** | ETag mismatch (for updates) |


IF-Match
-------
Client fetches resource + ETag

Client sends update with If-Match

Server checks:

If ETag matches → update allowed

If not → reject request

➡️ Prevents lost updates in concurrent systems.

| Type       | Example      | Meaning                                      |
| ---------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Strong** | `"abc123"`   | Exact content match                          |
| **Weak**   | `W/"abc123"` | Semantically same, minor differences allowed |



✅ What is Pagination?

Pagination is the technique of dividing large datasets into smaller chunks (pages) and returning them step-by-step instead of all at once.


🔹 Types of Pagination (VERY IMPORTANT FOR MCQs)
1️⃣ Offset-based Pagination
2️⃣ Cursor-based Pagination
3️⃣ Page-based Pagination


1️⃣ Offset-Based Pagination
limit → how many records

offset → how many to skip


Slow for large offsets

Duplicate / missing records if data changes

Not scalable


| Level     | Meaning       | Usage           |
| --------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| **DEBUG** | Detailed info | Dev debugging   |
| **INFO**  | Normal events | App flow        |
| **WARN**  | Something odd | Not fatal       |
| **ERROR** | Failure       | Needs attention |
| **FATAL** | App crash     | System stopping |


❌ Logging improves performance → WRONG

❌ Logs replace monitoring → WRONG

❌ DEBUG logs in production are safe → WRONG

❌ Logs should store sensitive data → WRONG





What is an Audit?

Audit means:

Recording and reviewing who did what, when, and sometimes why, to ensure accountability, compliance, and traceability.


✅ What is the Bulkhead Pattern?

The Bulkhead Pattern is a fault-isolation design pattern that prevents a failure in one part of a system from bringing down the entire system.
