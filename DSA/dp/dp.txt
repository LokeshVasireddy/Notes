813.You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. You can partition the array into at most k non-empty adjacent subarrays. The score of a partition is the sum of the averages of each subarray.

Note that the partition must use every integer in nums, and that the score is not necessarily an integer.

Return the maximum score you can achieve of all the possible partitions. Answers within 10-6 of the actual answer will be accepted.

Problem statement
A Derangement is a permutation of ‘N’ elements, such that no element appears in its original position. For example, an instance of derangement of {0, 1, 2, 3} is {2, 3, 1, 0}, because 2 present at index 0 is not at its initial position which is 2 and similarly for other elements of the sequence.

Given a number ‘N’, find the total number of derangements possible of a set of 'N’ elements.

Note:
The answer could be very large, output answer %(10 ^ 9 + 7).
