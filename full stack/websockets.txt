Polling
------
Polling is a technique where a client repeatedly asks a server,which is an overkill.to solve this we have web sockets.

Web sockets
---------
Initially client sends an http request to server in those headers server is asked to upgrade it to web sockets.
Server handles it and sends an id.

The HTTP Upgrade request and response header can be used to upgrade an already-established client/server connection to a different protocol (over the same transport protocol).


The main purpose is:
To serve static files (like HTML, CSS, JS, images) to clients from a specific folder.
🔹 What “static” means here
Static files are files that don’t change on the server.
Examples:
index.html → web page
style.css → styles
script.js → client-side JavaScript
Images (.png, .jpg, etc.) For example, it can be used by a client to upgrade a connection from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2, or an HTTP(S) connection to a WebSocket connection.
Access in browser:
http://localhost:3000/ex.js
http://localhost:3000/style.css

app.use(express.static("folder")) makes all files in that folder available to the client over HTTP — like putting your files on a mini web server automatically.



What is NGINX?
-----------------
NGINX (pronounced “engine-x”) is a high-performance web server and reverse proxy server.

It’s widely used for:
Serving static websites (HTML, CSS, JS, images)
Reverse proxying (forwarding requests to backend servers)
Load balancing (distributing traffic across multiple servers)
Caching (storing responses to improve performance)
SSL/TLS termination (handling HTTPS connections)
