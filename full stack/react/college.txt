| Package     | What it does                  |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| `react`     | Components, hooks, JSX, state |
| `react-dom` | Talks to the browser DOM      |



React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, mainly for Single Page Applications (SPA).

A React component is a reusable, self-contained piece of UI that returns what should appear on the screen.

What React.StrictMode is

A wrapper component that intentionally runs extra checks in development.

🔹 MPA (Multi Page Application)

Page reload on every request

Server renders new HTML

Slower UX

🔹 SPA (Single Page Application)

Single HTML file

JS updates UI dynamically

Faster, smoother experience

| Feature       | MPA              | SPA         |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| Page reloads  | Every navigation | Once        |
| Routing       | Server-side      | Client-side |
| UX            | Traditional      | App-like    |
| SEO           | Easy             | Needs setup |
| Initial load  | Fast             | Slower      |
| JS dependency | Low              | High        |
| Complexity    | Lower            | Higher      |


Hooks
------
Hooks let functional components use state and lifecycle features (earlier only possible in class components).
Hooks allow us to use React features like state and lifecycle methods inside functional components.

Rules of Hooks
Rule 1: Call hooks at the top level

❌ Not inside loops, conditions, or functions

Rule 2: Call hooks only inside React functions

✔️ Functional components
✔️ Custom hooks


To keep hook call order consistent across renders.


Usestate
-------
useState is a React Hook that lets a functional component store, read, and update state.
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
setCount(prev => prev + 1);

const [user, setUser] = useState({
  name: "Loki",
  age: 25
});

setUser(prev => ({
  ...prev,
  age: prev.age + 1
}));



Re-render

State/props change

Component function runs again

State is preserved

Re-mount

Component removed & added

State resets



useRef
------
useRef lets you store a mutable value that persists across renders without causing a re-render.
import { useRef } from "react";

const ref = useRef(initialValue);
Returns an object: { current: initialValue }

The object stays the same between renders




useReducer
----------
useReducer is a Hook used to manage complex state logic using a reducer function.

const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "INC": return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case "DEC": return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default: return state;
  }
};

const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: 0 });


useContext
📘 Definition
------------
useContext is a Hook used to access shared data from React Context without prop drilling.

useEffect Hook (React)
---------------
useEffect is used to handle side effects in functional components.
useEffect is a React Hook that lets you perform side effects such as data fetching, subscriptions, 
and DOM updates after rendering.
