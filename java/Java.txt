| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| C / C++  | Compiled directly to OS-specific machine code       |

.java  →  javac  →  .class (bytecode)  →  JVM  →  Machine code


🧠 What is JVM?

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine that:

Executes Java bytecode

Manages memory

Handles garbage collection

Provides runtime environment

💡 JVM is platform dependent, but bytecode is platform independent.

| Component | Purpose                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------- |
| JVM       | Runs bytecode                     |
| JRE       | JVM + core libraries              |
| JDK       | JRE + dev tools (javac, debugger) |
Java compiles to bytecode

JVM executes bytecode

JVM handles memory, GC, threads, security

Architecture = Class Loader + Memory + Execution Engine


1️⃣ Class Loader Subsystem

Responsible for loading .class files into JVM.

Steps:

Loading – reads .class file

Linking

Verification (bytecode safety)

Preparation (static memory)

Resolution (symbolic references)

Initialization – static variables & blocks


Execution Engine

Executes bytecode.

Components:

Interpreter → executes line by line

JIT Compiler → converts hot code to native machine code
JIT (Just-In-Time) Compiler is a part of the JVM that converts frequently executed bytecode (“hot code”) into native machine code at runtime.

Garbage Collector → frees unused objects

Class Loader

Bytecode Verifier
    ↓
Runtime Memory (Heap, Stack, Method Area)
    ↓
Execution Engine (Interpreter + JIT)
    ↓
Native OS / Hardware


Strings
------
String s1 = "Java";
Stored in String Constant Pool (SCP) (inside heap)

String s3 = new String("Java");
"Java" in SCP (if not present)

New object in heap

s1 == s3 → false





| Type            | Mutability  | Thread-safe | Memory           | Speed            |
| --------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| `String`        | ❌ Immutable | ✅ Yes       | Efficient (pool) | Slow for changes |
| `StringBuilder` | ✅ Mutable   | ❌ No        | Heap             | Fast             |
| `StringBuffer`  | ✅ Mutable   | ✅ Yes       | Heap             | Slower           |

String s = "Java";
s = s + " World";
New String object is created in the heap, not in the String Pool.
Why?
Result is computed at runtime
JVM does not automatically pool runtime strings



Static language
-------------
Perform type checking at compile time
Errors will show at compile time
Declare datatype before using it
More control
Ex:- java, c,c++

Dynamic language
--------------
Vice versa

What Is Garbage Collection?

Garbage collection (GC) is the process of automatically managing memory in a programming language — it frees up memory that’s no longer being used by the program.when there is no reference variable pointing towards the object.


finalize() is a method of the Object class that is called by the Garbage Collector before an object is destroyed.
protected void finalize() {
    System.out.println("Object is garbage collected");
}


public

Accessible from anywhere

protected

Accessible within the same package

Also accessible in subclasses (even in different packages)

default (no keyword)

Accessible only within the same package

private

Accessible only within the same class



Final
--------
final is used to restrict modification.
Final variable → value cannot be changed

Final method → cannot be overridden

Final class → cannot be inherited


| `final`                        | `static`                             |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Prevents change                | Shares across objects                |
| Used for restriction           | Used for memory sharing              |
| Can be variable, method, class | Used with variables, methods, blocks |
| Value fixed                    | Value can change                     |



OOPS
-----
Object
An instance of a class stored in heap memory.

Encapsulation = binding data + methods together and restricting direct access using access modifiers.
class Student {
    private int age;
    public void setAge(int a) { age = a; }
    public int getAge() { return age; }
}


Inheritance (IS-A relationship)

Allows a class to inherit properties & methods of another class.
class Parent {}
class Child extends Parent {}


Polymorphism (“many forms”)

A. Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)

Same method name, different parameters.
void sum(int a, int b) {}
void sum(double a, double b) {}


method1 → method2 → method3
If exception occurs in method3 and not handled → moves back to method2 → method1 → JVM.

Custom Exceptions
class AgeException extends Exception {
    AgeException(String msg) { super(msg); }
}






1️⃣ Can a static block throw an exception?
✅ Yes — but with rules
static {
    int x = 10 / 0;   // RuntimeException
}

Key points

✅ Unchecked exceptions (RuntimeException) can be thrown

❌ Checked exceptions cannot be thrown unless handled inside the block

❌ Not allowed:

static {
    throw new IOException(); // compile-time error
}


✅ Allowed:

static {
    try {
        throw new IOException();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}

❗ What happens if an exception escapes?

Class fails to load

JVM throws ExceptionInInitializerError

📌 Interview line:

“Static blocks can throw unchecked exceptions; checked exceptions must be handled inside, otherwise class loading fails.”




2️⃣ Why is String immutable in Java?
Short answer (interview gold):

For security, thread safety, performance, and caching.

Detailed reasons
🔐 Security

Used in passwords, file paths, URLs, class loaders

Prevents modification after creation

🧵 Thread safety

Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe

No synchronization needed

⚡ Performance (String Pool)

JVM reuses strings from the String Constant Pool

Immutability allows safe sharing

🔑 HashCode caching

String is widely used as a key in HashMap

Cached hash value → faster lookups



3️⃣ Is LinkedList in Java singly or doubly linked?
✅ Doubly linked list
java.util.LinkedList

Why?

Each node has:

reference to previous

reference to next

Benefits

Efficient:

insertion

deletion

bidirectional traversal

Tradeoff

❌ More memory (extra pointer)

❌ Slower random access than ArrayList

📌 Interview line:

“Java’s LinkedList is a doubly linked list, which allows efficient insertions and deletions in both directions.”
