Class:
A class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties (data) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that type will have.

Object:
An object is an instance of a class that represents a real-world entity and contains actual values for the properties defined by the class.

| Stack                                   | Heap                             |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Stores local variables and method calls | Stores objects and dynamic data  |
| Memory managed automatically            | Memory managed manually or by GC |
| Faster access                           | Slower access                    |
| Limited size                            | Larger size                      |
| Uses LIFO order                         | No specific order                |


Instance variables are variables declared inside a class but outside methods, and each object (instance) of the class has its own separate copy of these variables. 
They store data that is unique to each object and are created when an object is created.(belong to object not the class)

Class Variables (Static Variables):
Class variables are shared by all objects of the class. Only one copy exists in memory, and it belongs to the class itself, not to individual instances.

this keyword:
The this keyword is a reference variable that refers to the current object of the class and is used to access instance variables and methods of that object.

Inheritance:-
-----------
Inheritance is an object-oriented programming concept in which one class (subclass/child class) acquires the properties and methods of another class (superclass/parent class).
Promotes code reusability

Achieved using the extends keyword in Java

Supports IS-A relationship

Enables method overriding


Single, multi level,heirarchy,multiple(Ambiguity → compile-time error),hybrid

// Parent class
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal eats");
    }
}

// Child class
class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();   // Dog is an Animal
        d.eat();             // inherited method
        d.bark();            // child method
    }
}




Polymorphism
------------
Compile time and runtime

class Payment {
    void pay() {
        System.out.println("Processing payment");
    }
}

class CardPayment extends Payment {
    void pay() {
        System.out.println("Card payment");
    }
}

class UPIPayment extends Payment {
    void pay() {
        System.out.println("UPI payment");
    }
}


// Parent class
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

// Child class
class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Dog();   // Upcasting
        a.sound();              // Calls Dog's method
    }
}


What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data (variables) and methods together into a single unit and controlling access to the data.
class BankAccount {
    public double balance;
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount acc = new BankAccount();
        acc.balance = -10000;   // invalid but allowed ❌
    }
}



Abstraction
-----------
Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and showing only essential features to the user.
abstract class Vehicle {
    abstract void start();

    void fuelType() {
        System.out.println("Uses fuel");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Car starts with key");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle v = new Car();
        v.start();
        v.fuelType();
    }
}

interface A {
    void show();
}

interface B {
    void show();
}

class C implements A, B {
    public void show() {
        System.out.println("Resolved");
    }
}

Interfaces have no instance state

No instance variables

No constructors

No memory collision
