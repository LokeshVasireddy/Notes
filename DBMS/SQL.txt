A VIEW in SQL is a virtual table that is created from the result of a query.
It behaves like a table, but it does not store data (usually).
Instead, it stores the query, and each time you use the view, SQL runs that query.

CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;



Keys are special fields (columns) used to:

Uniquely identify rows

Link tables together

Maintain data integrity

Speed up searches
