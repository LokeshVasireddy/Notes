DBMS Architecture (IMPORTANT)
🔹 1-Tier Architecture

User directly interacts with DB

Used for local applications

Example: SQLite

🔹 2-Tier Architecture

Client ↔ DB server

Used in desktop apps

🔹 3-Tier Architecture (🔥 VERY IMPORTANT)

Presentation layer (UI)

Application layer (logic)

Database layer
Browser → Server → Database



Core Components of DBMS
🔹 Query Processor

Parses SQL
Optimizes query
Executes query

🔹 Storage Manager

Manages files
Manages memory
Handles transactions

🔹 Transaction Manager

Ensures ACID properties
Handles commit & rollback



ER (Entity–Relationship) model is a conceptual data model used to design a database.
ER model shows what data to store and how data is related.

An entity is a real-world object that can be uniquely identified.



Types of Entities
1️⃣ Strong Entity

Has its own primary key

Example: Student (RollNo)

2️⃣ Weak Entity (🔥 EXAM FAVORITE)

Does not have a primary key

Depends on a strong entity

Has a partial key



| Type          | Meaning         | Example            |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Simple        | Atomic          | Age                |
| Composite     | Has sub-parts   | Name → First, Last |
| Single-valued | One value       | RollNo             |
| Multi-valued  | Multiple values | Phone numbers      |
| Derived       | Calculated      | Age from DOB       |




1️⃣ Total Participation

Every entity must participate

Represented by double line

2️⃣ Partial Participation

Some entities may not participate

Represented by single line



2️⃣ Schema vs Instance (VERY COMMON)

Schema → Structure of table (fixed)

Instance → Data inside table (changes frequently)



Keys
----
a key is an attribute or a set of attributes that helps in uniquely identifying a tuple (row) in a relation (table). 
Keys play a crucial role in maintaining data integrity, establishing relationships between tables, and supporting normaliza


Super key
--------
A super key is a set of one or more attributes that can uniquely identify a row (tuple) in a table.

Candidate Key (DBMS)

A candidate key is a minimal set of attributes that can uniquely identify a row (tuple) in a table.

Secondary KeyA secondary key is used for searching and indexing but does not uniquely identify records


Cursor
-----
A Cursor in DBMS is a database object used to retrieve, process, and manipulate records row by row from a result set returned by an SQL query. 
Normally, SQL works on a set of rows at a time, but cursors allow tuple-by-tuple processing.


What is Indexing?
🔹 Definition (INTERVIEW ONE-LINER)

Indexing is a data structure technique used to speed up data retrieval from a database table.

Types of Indexes
----------------
1.Primary Index

Built on primary key

Data is stored in sorted order

One per table

2️⃣ Secondary Index

Built on non-primary key

Used for searching non-key attributes

3️⃣ Clustered Index (🔥 VERY IMPORTANT)

Data rows are physically sorted

Only ONE clustered index per table

4️⃣ Non-Clustered Index

Index stored separately from data

Can have multiple

| Feature       | B-Tree    | B+ Tree         |
| ------------- | --------- | --------------- |
| Data location | All nodes | Leaf nodes only |
| Range queries | Slower    | Faster          |
| Disk I/O      | More      | Less            |
